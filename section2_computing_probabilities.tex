\section{Computing Probabilities}
\paragraph{Recall}
For a discrete sample space $S = \lbrace w_1, w_2, w_3, \dots \rbrace$,
probability of any event $E$, $P(E)$ is given by 
\begin{equation*}
    P(E) = \sum_{w_i \in E} P(\lbrace w_i \rbrace)
\end{equation*}
So given an experiment, in order to compute probabilities of events, one can
first compute the probability of each sample point (i.e. $P(\lbrace w_i
\rbrace)$, and then for any event $E$, $P(E)$ will be given by sum of the
probabilities of sample points that are elements of $E$ (i.e. using the
equation above).

\paragraph{Special case}: If the sample space $S$ is finite and each outcome is
equally likely, then $\forall w \in S$, 
\begin{equation*}
    P(\lbrace w \rbrace) = \frac{1}{\vert S \vert}
\end{equation*}
Hence, 
\begin{equation*}
    P(E) = \frac{\vert E \vert}{\vert S \vert} \quad \forall E \subseteq S
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
    Products manufactured in a facility are tested for defects. Historical
records indicate that $8\%$ of products have a type A defect, $6\%$ have a type
B defect, and $2\%$ have both type of defects. If one item is chosen at random,
what is the probability that, 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item it has exactly one type of defect?
    \item it is not defective?
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{solution} Let $A$ denote the event that the item has a type A
defect, and let $B$ denote the item has a type B defect. Then, $P(A) = 0.08$,
$P(B) = 0.06$ and $P(A \cap B) = 0.02$.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item
    The event that the item has exactly one type of defect is represented by, 
    \begin{align*}
        A \triangle B &= (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)                \\
        P(A \setminus B) &= P(A) - P(A \cap B)                               \\
        P(B \setminus A) &= P(B) - P(A \cap B)
    \end{align*}
    Since $A \setminus B$ and $B \setminus A$ are disjoint, 
    \begin{align*}
        P(A \triangle B) &= P(A \setminus B) + P(B \setminus A)              \\
                         &= P(A) + P(B) - 2 P(A \cap B)                      \\
                         &= 0.08 + 0.06 - 2 \cdot 0.02 = 0.1
    \end{align*}
\item
    The event that the item is not defective is given by $(A \cup
    B)^\complement$. Now,
    \begin{align*}
        P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)                             \\
                    &= 0.08 + 0.06 - 0.02                                    \\
                    &= 0.12
    \end{align*}
    Hence, 
    \begin{align*}
        P((A \cup B)^\complement) &= 1 - P(A \cup B)                         \\
                                  &= 1 - 0.12                                \\
                                  &= 0.88
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
